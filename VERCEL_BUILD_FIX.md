# Vercel Build Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue
Vercel build was failing with the following errors:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/AuthDebug'
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/SupabaseTest'
```

## Root Cause
The `layout.tsx` file contained imports and usage of debug components (`AuthDebug` and `SupabaseTest`) that were created for testing but were removed from the filesystem. However, the imports and JSX usage were not cleaned up, causing the build to fail.

## Fix Applied
1. **Removed unused imports** from `src/app/layout.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // REMOVED:
   import AuthDebug from "@/components/AuthDebug";
   import SupabaseTest from "@/components/SupabaseTest";
   ```

2. **Removed unused components** from JSX:
   ```typescript
   // REMOVED:
   <AuthDebug />
   <SupabaseTest />
   ```

3. **Fixed unused variable warning** in `SupabaseConnectionTest.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE:
   const { data, error } = await supabase...
   
   // AFTER:
   const { error } = await supabase...
   ```

## Build Status
- ✅ **Local Build**: Successful
- ✅ **No Errors**: All module resolution issues fixed
- ✅ **No Warnings**: Unused variable warnings resolved
- ✅ **GitHub**: Latest changes pushed to master branch
- ✅ **Vercel Ready**: Build should now succeed on Vercel

✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

## Next Steps
1. **Vercel will automatically redeploy** from the latest GitHub commit
2. **Build should now succeed** without any module resolution errors
3. **Application will be live** once Vercel deployment completes

## Verification
- All imports are valid and components exist
- No unused variables or dead code
- Build passes locally with no errors or warnings
- Ready for production deployment
